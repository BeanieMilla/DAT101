      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[You should use constants when you wish to set a value which will not under any circumstance, change throughout the code. For example, a value that will typically be constant is Pi. This is because the value do not change. You need variables in your code, because by default some data is meant to change. You need a balance between constant and variables, because you need flexibility to handle unpredictable data, while setting values that wont change throughout your code.]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[The parentheses indicates grouping, that everything in the parentheses is related to the outcome. So if you for example put a mathematical equation in a parentheses, it will only solve the equation listed in between. Using parentheses will also give clarity, and will prevent misunderstandings from happening.]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[I am a bit unsure how to answer this question, I chose to use ChatGPT to assist solving this task. When I first asked ChatGPT, it gave me a command that I have never heard of which made me take a better look into my notes. After some digging I found the “Floor” and “Ceil” commands which are used to round up or down numbers for when you want to limit decimals. Floor is used for round down, Ceil is used for round up]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[I had to ask ChatGPT to help me get a better understanding of this question, where I purposely asked the AI to answer the question in the light of the “floor” and “ceil” commands. It gave me an answer which makes sense according to what I have learned so far about the commands. According to ChatGPT “you can round the numbers to a specific number of decimal places before comparison, or use a tolerance value to determine if they are "close enough" to be considered equal.” If they are not considered equal you might run into some small rounding errors.]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[When you wish to compare two values, you can use different operators to do so. for example you == means they are equal. != means not equal to. You also have > which can be used to compare values which are either greater or less than each other. if the result of the comparison is correct according to operator you have chosen, you get TRUE,  however if i claim 5 > 6 (this means that 5 is greater than 6, which its not) you will get FALSE.]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[According to chatGPT, Math.random can generate random numbers, and can be used for games (for example, generating loot drops, enemy spawns etc.), simulations (for example, dice rolls) etc. ]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[According to w3schools, The modulus (also called remainder), is an operator that returns the division remainder. In fewer words, the modulus operator tells you the leftover part of your value after dividing two numbers. According to chatGPT you can also use the operator to check if numbers are odd or even, looping through lists, creating patterns and handling time.  ]
